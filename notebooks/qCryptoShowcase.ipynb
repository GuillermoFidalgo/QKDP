    "## Introduction\n",
    "\n",
    "This notebook presents the key features of `qcrypto`, a Python library for the simulation of simple quantum cryptography simulations. The primary classes of this library are `QstateEnt` and `QstateUnEnt`. These classes are used to represent the quantum state of a set of qubits. The former is the most general, with which one is capable of simulating the state of a possibility entangled set of qubits, whereas the latter can only be used to simulate a system of qubits which are definitely unentangled. Despite this limitation, `QstateUnEnt` offers higher performance making it ideal for simpler simulations in which the user only needs to construct a system of unentangled qubits.\n",
    "\n",
    "The way these two classes encode the quantum state is different. \n",
    "\n",
    "## Unentangled State Representation\n",
    "\n",
    "If a set of $N$ qubits are unentangled, and the $i$'th qubit's state is given by $\\ket\\psi_i$, then the state of the system as a whole, $\\ket \\psi$ can be represented as:\n",
    "$$\n",
    "    \\ket\\psi = \\bigotimes_{i=0}^{N} c_i \\ket\\psi_i\n",
    "$$\n",
    "If $\\psi^{(j)}_i$ represents the probability amplitude that the $i$'th qubit will be measured to be in state $\\ket j$, where $j\\in\\{0, 1\\}$, then this can be vectorially represented in the following manner:\n",
    "$$\n",
    "    \\ket\\psi =  \\bigotimes_{i=0}^{N} \\begin{pmatrix} \\psi^{(0)}_i \\\\ \\psi^{(1)}_i \\end{pmatrix}\n",
    "$$\n",
    "`QstateUnEnt` takes advantaged of the separability of the state of each individual qubit by representing the state of the system as a whole as a $N \\times 2$ dimensional numpy array where each row corresponds to a qubit and each column the probability amplitude of each possible state of each individual qubit. Moreover, for simplicity, each qubit state is normalized separately."

    "## Measurements\n",
    "\n",
    "In order to measure a qubit, one can call the `measure` method, which requires the specification of which qubit is to measured, or the `measure_all` method, which measures all of the qubits. For `QstateUnEnt`, `measure_all` simply applies `measure` to all qubits sequentially. However, for `QstateEnt`, because the order of measurement is important, requires the user to specify if the system should be measured simultaneously (all qubits measured at one), or sequentially.\n",
    "\n",
    "When measurements are made, the state of the system is updated in order to reflect the collapse of the quantum state of the system and the method returns the result of the measurement. We can observe that in the following cells."

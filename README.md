# Quantum Key Distribution Protocol BB84
The program should:  
1. use a random number generator at every point in the protocol where random numbers are needed, 
2. be interactive allowing the user to run the program as many times as he/she likes and only stopping when the user wants to quit, 
3. the user chooses if he wants Eve will be there or not, 
4. the user chooses the length of the initial bit-string and how many bits will be used to verify the security of the key, 
5. the program must be fully commented, 
6. along with the key produced, the program should calculate all relevant statistics such as probability that the key is compromised, percentage of discarded bits and percentage of bits that Eve gets. These are just some examples, I'm sure you can think of more.

## Disclaimer 
Depending on the parameters used for the simulation of BB84 this may take a long time. Please be patient in order to see the results.
